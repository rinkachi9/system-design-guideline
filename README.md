# System Design – Personal Guideline & Architecture Playbook

## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains my **personal guideline and architecture playbook** for system design.  
It reflects my standardized approach to designing, documenting, and operating modern distributed systems.  
The content is written in **Markdown** so it can be reused as reference material, templates, or checklists for real-world projects.

The playbook is based on:
- **Industry best practices** (SRE, DDD, ATAM, Twelve-Factor, Team Topologies, etc.)
- **Proven frameworks & standards** (C4 model, ADRs, SLOs, OWASP, NIST, ISO)
- **Hands-on experience** with cloud-native, security-focused, and high-scale systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Document a **structured approach** to system design.
- Provide **checklists and templates** for security, observability, testing, and reliability.
- Capture **decision-making practices** (ADRs, trade-offs, SDD).
- Serve as a **personal reference** and portfolio of my architectural thinking.
- Encourage **collaboration and improvement** by sharing knowledge openly.

## 🧩 Key topics covered
- **End-to-End System Design Process** (requirements → delivery → operations)
- **Quality Attributes Analysis** (availability, consistency, durability, latency, recovery, cost)
- **Decision-Making** (ADRs, ATAM, trade-offs)
- **Documentation Standards** (C4, SDD, templates)
- **Reliability & Resilience** (SLOs, chaos, failover)
- **Security & Privacy** (threat modeling, zero trust, supply chain)
- **Observability** (metrics, logs, traces, runbooks)
- **Testing Strategy** (unit → contract → E2E, performance, chaos)
- **Recovery & Continuity** (RTO/RPO, DR)
- **Architecture Principles & Heuristics** (my personal playbook)
